Ruchika is a firm believer that food can be medicine, and was looking for healthier carbohydrate alternatives. Through her research she came upon the marvelous world of millets. She wanted to bring this ancient crop, that was once a staple, back to its former prominence.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to incorporate this phenomenal grain into her family\'s diet, Ruchika saw how challenging it was to include millets and acclimatize tastebuds that were so accustomed to rice and wheat. This inspired her to develop recipes to make it easier for families to include tasty millet dishes and even satisfy the pickiest of palates, so they too can experience the benefits of millets.\r\n\r\nRuchika’s mission was driven by millets being not only healthy, but also beneficial to the environment and economy of the farmer community. She started developing recipes to offer millet-based alternatives to accommodate various cuisines and dietary preferences- so that more people can start consuming millets as their staple. This is where our name ‘Millet Amma’ comes from. It was the endearing nickname given to her by her husband because of all the millet meals she keeps creating.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Millet and Millet based Products,We\'ve come a long way from supplying batters to family and friends from Ruchika\'s kitchen, to today where we’ve taken an omni-channel approach for distribution from where we serve several families in India and around the world.

Witnessing the detrimental impact of unprocessed solid waste on our environment, public health, and urban ecosystems motivated me to seek innovative and sustainable solutions.\r\nMy vision is to create a world where waste is no longer a problem but a resource, empowering communities to transition from linear waste disposal systems to circular economies. My work aims to revolutionize solid waste management by introducing groundbreaking technologies like the Dross-Magic machine, which offers efficient and eco-friendly solutions for mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal.\r\nThe mission of this initiative is threefold:\r\n1.	Environmental Sustainability: To significantly reduce landfill dependency and greenhouse gas emissions by converting waste into reusable resources.\r\n2.	Community Empowerment: To involve local stakeholders in waste management processes, creating job opportunities and fostering environmental stewardship.\r\n3.	Innovation and Scalability: To develop and deploy cutting-edge technologies that can adapt to various waste management challenges globally.\r\nThis vision was further fueled by the realization that effective waste management is not just a technical issue but a societal one. Through collaboration, education, and technological advancement, I aspire to drive positive change, making sustainable waste management accessible to all, while leaving a lasting legacy for future generations.\r\nMy journey is a testament to the power of innovation and leadership in addressing social and environmental challenges.\r\n', '  The core problem addressed by my work is the mismanagement of mixed municipal solid waste (MSW), which poses severe social, environmental, and economic challenges. Unprocessed waste leads to overflowing landfills, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and significant health hazards in communities. Furthermore, waste mismanagement often results in the loss of valuable resources that could be repurposed, creating a missed opportunity for economic gain.\r\nTo tackle this multifaceted issue, I developed the Dross-Magic machine, an innovative solution designed for efficient solid waste disposal. This advanced technology integrates a speed-to-weight ratio mechanism that dynamically adjusts its operations for optimal processing. Starting at a 1:30 ratio and transitioning to a 0:100 ratio, the system ensures high energy efficiency and maximum waste separation.\r\nThe Dross-Magic machine\'s versatility enables it to process diverse waste types, including biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and mixed waste, converting them into usable byproducts such as compost, recyclable materials, and energy. By minimizing landfill dependency, it reduces environmental degradation and greenhouse gas emissions.\r\nSocially, this innovation empowers local communities by involving them in waste segregation and creating job opportunities. Economically, it transforms waste into resources, fostering a circular economy.\r\nWhat makes this solution unique is its scalability and adaptability. The system is designed to meet the needs of urban and rural areas alike, ensuring widespread impact. By addressing waste at its source, the Dross-Magic machine not only resolves immediate waste challenges but also contributes to long-term environmental sustainability.\r\n', '  The Dross-Magic machine has significantly impacted the market by revolutionizing waste management practices and creating new economic opportunities, particularly for underserved populations. This innovation has opened doors for sustainable development in communities that previously struggled with waste disposal challenges.\r\nOne of the most notable impacts is the creation of a circular economy model, where waste is no longer treated as a burden but as a resource. By converting waste into compost, recyclable materials, and energy, the Dross-Magic machine has enabled municipalities and industries to reduce landfill dependency, lower operational costs, and generate additional revenue streams.\r\nA success story comes from a pilot project in a semi-urban community where the Dross-Magic machine was deployed. The initiative resulted in a 40% reduction in waste sent to landfills within six months. Furthermore, it empowered local waste pickers by integrating them into formal waste management systems, providing steady incomes and safer working conditions.\r\nThe initiative has also introduced micro-entrepreneurship opportunities. For instance, individuals trained to operate and maintain the machine have started small-scale businesses, offering waste processing services to nearby communities.\r\nIn underserved rural areas, the machine has addressed long-standing waste issues while fostering community engagement and environmental awareness. These outcomes have encouraged local governments and private organizations to adopt similar models, amplifying the solution’s reach.\r\nThe Dross-Magic machine’s market impact lies in its ability to create scalable, sustainable systems that benefit the environment, enhance livelihoods, and empower communities toward self-reliance.\r\n', '  The initiatives powered by the Dross-Magic machine have profoundly contributed to the welfare of society and the environment. By addressing the critical issue of waste mismanagement, these efforts have created tangible social and environmental benefits, transforming how communities perceive and handle waste.\r\nOne of the most significant contributions is the reduction of waste sent to landfills. By efficiently processing mixed municipal solid waste, the machine has helped divert up to 60% of waste from landfills in areas where it has been implemented. This reduction directly mitigates greenhouse gas emissions, soil contamination, and groundwater pollution, contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment.\r\nSocially, the initiative has empowered underserved communities by creating jobs and fostering inclusivity. Local waste pickers, often marginalized and working in unsafe conditions, have been integrated into formal waste management systems, receiving fair wages and protective gear. Training programs have further enabled these individuals to acquire new skills, enhancing their employability and financial independence.\r\nEducational campaigns accompanying the deployment of the Dross-Magic machine have raised environmental awareness, promoting responsible waste segregation and recycling practices. This shift in behavior has strengthened community participation in sustainable waste management, laying the foundation for long-term change.\r\nMoreover, the compost and recyclable materials generated by the machine have been used to support local agriculture and small-scale businesses, fostering economic resilience.\r\nBy blending innovation with social responsibility, this initiative has significantly improved environmental conditions and uplifted communities, exemplifying the potential of technology-driven social entrepreneurship.\r\n', '  The long-term vision for the Dross-Magic initiative is to establish a global benchmark for sustainable waste management, where waste is not only efficiently disposed of but also transformed into valuable resources. The goal is to create a world where every community, regardless of size or location, can implement effective waste management solutions that enhance environmental sustainability and economic resilience.\r\nTo achieve this, the first step is to scale the initiative at the national level. Partnerships with municipal corporations, private industries, and government agencies will ensure widespread adoption of the Dross-Magic machine in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. Customized solutions will address the unique waste challenges of each region, enhancing adaptability and impact.\r\nFuture plans include integrating advanced technologies such as AI and IoT to optimize waste processing efficiency and monitor environmental impact in real-time. These enhancements will make the system smarter, reducing operational costs and increasing effectiveness.\r\nAnother key strategy involves empowering local entrepreneurs and organizations to take ownership of waste management solutions. By offering franchising opportunities and training programs, the initiative will create a network of community-driven waste management enterprises.\r\nInternationally, the focus will be on forming collaborations with global environmental organizations, adapting the Dross-Magic machine to meet diverse regulatory and cultural requirements.\r\nEducational campaigns and policy advocacy will amplify public awareness and government support, driving systemic change. Through these measures, the initiative aims to scale its impact globally, contributing to a cleaner, healthier planet for generations to come.\r\n', NULL, 'uploads/1736759354-18036/1736833066_nyXB902O_MSME_Certificate_Dross.pdf', 'uploads/1736759354-18036/1736833066_nyXB902O_Certificate_of_Incorporation_Dross.pdf', 'uploads/1736759354-18036/1736833066_nyXB902O_applicable.pdf', 'uploads/1736759354-18036/1736833066_nyXB902O_DROSS_PPT_Meerut_compressed.pdf', 'uploads/1736759354-18036/1736833066_nyXB902O_impact.pdf', 'uploads/1736759354-18036/1736833066_nyXB902O_others.pdf', NULL, 'Amardeep Sharma', 'drosstogold275@gmail.com', '8837673413', '6', 3, 110, 'yes', '5167681127', '2025-01-14 07:29:24', '2025-01-13 09:17:08'),
